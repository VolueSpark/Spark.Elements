# Spark Elements

## Introduction

Spark Elements is a component library consisting of "plug-and-play" components with opinionated figures rendering data from the Spark APIs. Every component is built in such a way that the response from the relevant API call may be passed into the component. Components have undergone thorough user testing and adhere to principles regarding universal design (UD).
