## Usage

The spot price components are used to visualize real-time information on optimal charging times for EV owners based on spot prices from Nord Pool for a chosen area. They may be used to create applications that provide EV owners with accurate and up-to-date information to decide when to charge their vehicles within the hours Nord Pool has set the spot prices.

## How to use

-   Use the graphs to provide information about when it’s the best time to charge within the known hours of spot prices from Nord Pool
-   The graphs should always appear with information about what the different marked areas indicate
    -   Optimal hours
    -   Try to avoid
-   Use an accessible color palette. If it’s hard to differ the bars from each other, adding patterns to them is a possibility
